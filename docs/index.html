<p>This documents describes the requirements for a 3D webviewer for sharing a nation-wide 3D citymodel with the general public.</p>
<p>A 3D citymodel is a dataset that contains objects that are commonly found in cities such as buildings, roads, vegetation, terrain etc. Building objects are generally seen as the most prominent feature type of a 3D city model. Contrary to its name a city model doesn’t always refer to the extent of a city and can also contain parts that are not strictly part of a city. In fact, this document focuses on nation-wide 3D city models. Such a dataset contains objects for the whole country. The next iteration of the 3DBAG dataset and the new 3D Basisvoorziening by Kadaster can be considered such nation-wide 3D city models.</p>
<p><em>Why make an online 3D viewer for a nation-wide city model?</em><br>
The 3D Basisvoorziening is an open dataset that is generated and maintained for the public good from public money. Therefore it should also be publicly accessible. First, this means that the data needs to be disseminated in a usable data format so that everyone can easily download and use the data. Furthermore, considering the novel 3D aspect of a 3D city model (compared to other public datasets), it is also important to lower the barrier of discovering and exploring the data as much as possible. A user should be able to quickly see what such a dataset contains and what new possibilities it offers, without needing special technical skills or know-how.</p>
<p>A 3D webviewer, when implemented well, is a very effective tool to encourage such exploration and discovery of the nation-wide 3D city model. One only needs to click on a link to open and interactively explore the dataset directly on their device. The main benefits of having a 3D webviewer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 3D citymodel is best understood in a 3D environment.</li>
<li>Low barrier to access and see the nation-wide 3D city model. Just open the website and you can see everything, no other tools/steps required. No specific technical knowledge or skills required.</li>
<li>It is hip and good for publicity if done well.</li>
<li>It can serve as a platform to demonstrate what is possible with 3D (use in decision making/planning, show case results of environmental simlations like flooding, noise, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the remainder of this text we will 1) look at what is needed to make such a viewer succesful and discuss the relation of the  viewer to other parts of the dissemination infrastructure, 2) discuss the available technical components that are presently available and used. Finally, a summary with the main conclusions and suggestions is given at the end.</p>
<h2 id="general-requirements-and-components-of-the-viewer">General requirements and components of the viewer</h2>
<p>In order to understand what defines a succesful and good 3D web viewer we need to understand its requirements and how it fits in with the related infrastructure. The requirements are sorted by how important they are.</p>
<!-- *General requirements on the viewer, desired functionalities, viewer components* -->
<h4 id="high-priority-requirements-h">High priority requirements [H]</h4>
<p>These requirements need to be met in any case. A viewer that does not implement these requirements in a good manner will not be succesful.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Ability to view the buildings of the complete nation-wide 3D dataset in LoD1.2 or higher in a highly performant manner</em></p>
<p>Minimally with a 2D map as base layer. Must be performant and usable on mobile platforms. Important to minimise required network bandwidth and minimise computational load on the client, so that the user has a fluent experience without unnessecary delays or hiccups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Intuitive and easy to use</em></p>
<p>Keep the user interface and controls as simple as possible. People lose interest if things are unnecesarily complicated or unclear. The main audience of the viewer should be a general user and not a domain expert of 3D city models.x</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Open source</em></p>
<p>Both the used data/exchange formats and the viewer code itself must be open source. This encourages others to use the data and build their own functionalities with the viewer and contribute back their improvements.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="medium-priority-requirements-m">Medium priority requirements [M]</h4>
<p>These requirements make the viewer more appealing by introducing more features without increasing the complexity of the 3D scene. Therefore they will have minimal impact on the viewer performance, while stil greatly improving the appeal and usefulness of the viewer.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p><em>Ability to easily download data</em></p>
<p>By simply drawing a 2D (x/y axis-aligned) rectangle in the viewer for the area of interest, the user must be able to download the object contained in it. This 2D rectangle can then be used to perform a download query (to a separate download service) to download the underlying 3D citymodel object for the requested area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ability to query semantic information for 3D objects by clicking on them</em></p>
<p>The user must be able to retrieve and display attributes (semantics) of specific city objects (e.g. a building’s information). It is important that the viewer allows for inspection of all aspects of a city object (3D geometriy and attributes) so that the user knows exactly what the dataset offers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ability to switch between different LoDs for buildings</em></p>
<p>For LoD1.2, 1.3, and higher if available. At any time only one LoD is shown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Geocoding</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Connection with other data sources</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="low-priority-requirements-l">Low priority requirements [L]</h4>
<p>These are requirements that are nice to have in the long term. They have the potential to make the viewer significantly more interesting and useful, but when implemented poorly the performance of the viewer may deteriorate. Therefore these requirements should be carefully considered and implemented.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<p><em>Ability to visualise properties of objects</em></p>
<p>A simple example is to color the buildings according to some attribute/semantics (see for example this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc65iBk7YBU">SPOTinfo video</a>). This could be semantic information directly contained in the 3D city model itself, or from a linked dataset (see requirement M58). Preferred are use cases where 3D has real added value like facade level noise simulation results (very difficult to visualise on a 2D map).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ability to see nation-wide 3D Terrain</em></p>
<p>After 3D buildings are visualised, the visualisation of 3D terrain is the next logical step to be achieved. The simplest and most performant way to achieve this is to take a 3D mesh with a 2D map draped on it as a texture. This will work well with different terrain LoDs. Separate 3D terrain objects are technically also possible but are more complicated to get right with different LoDs and may have a bigger impact on performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ability to see other 3D objects than buildings and terrain</em></p>
<p>For example vegetation/trees, roads, transportation network and bridges. Depends on the availability of the data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="viewer-in-relation-to-other-infrastructure">Viewer in relation to other infrastructure</h2>
<p><em>What are the general software components the viewer would consists of? And would it fit in the bigger picture (eg relation to download service, existing postgis database)</em></p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: Diagram that shows the viewer in relation to separate download service/Postgis DB</p>
<p><img src="3dbag-viewer-infrastructure.png" alt="tk"></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Backend (server) is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serve the frontend application to the client</li>
<li>Some kind of mechanism to serve 3D geometry + semantic information
<ul>
<li>serve both semantics and geometry with same mechanism?</li>
<li>what is the link to how things are stored in PostgreSQL database? Can we serve straight from the DB, or do we need an intermediate format?</li>
<li>what standards are available?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frontend (client) is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>3D rendering</li>
<li>3D interaction (viewport control, picking, selection)</li>
<li>Dynamically retrieving data (geometry+semantics) from the server</li>
<li>User Interface (the conventional buttons, menu’s, dialogs etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="current-state-of-the-art">Current state of the art</h2>
<p>This section gives a non-exhaustive technical overview of the most popular currently available standards and libraries that can be used to realise a 3D web viewer.</p>
<h3 id="data-formatsstandards">Data formats/standards</h3>
<p>Several data formats are available to be used for such a solution. Originally, 3D data were mostly the focus of the 3D graphics domain, but lately more integration with geo-information data has been achieved. Below, is an overview of such formats that can be used by a web viewer for 3D city models.</p>
<h4 id="gltf"><a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/README.md">glTF</a></h4>
<p>A specification built by the Khronos group (the one that specifies open graphics specs such as OpenGL, WebGL, OpenCL, Vulkan etc.). It is mainly develop to accomodate WebGL on the efficient distribution and storage of 3D graphics data.</p>
<p>It’s main focus is efficient 3D data exchange for visualisation (e.g. games) and there is minimal support for any semantics. No CRS or other geographic information are supported by the standard.</p>
<p>Basically, a <code>gltf</code> file is a JSON that defines a scene graph. The assets of the graphs (3D models) are stored in binary formats also defined by the glTF specification.</p>
<h4 id="d-tiles"><a href="https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles">3D Tiles</a></h4>
<p>A specification originally developed by Cesium (previously AGI), today is an OGC <a href="https://www.ogc.org/standards/3DTiles">standard</a>. It defines two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>a tiling mechanism for 3D data, with functionality such as LoD (mostly refered to as “geometric error”), and</li>
<li>data formats for storing and exchanging 3D geodata.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tiling specification is extensive and provides a wide array of features. For a typical distribution of 3D city objects it is mostly overwhelming: the tiling aspect of a nation-wide 3D city model can be mostly served by a 2D scheme (especially in the Netherlands). 3D tiles’ complex specification is more appropriate when distribution across all three dimensions is important (e.g. point-clouds) or when used for heterogenous data (e.g. combination of 3D models and point-clouds).</p>
<p>Tiling is mainly done by a JSON file (tileset.json) which specifies the bounding box, data and other information for every tile.</p>
<p>Four (4) formats for the exchange of the 3D data are defined:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>b3dm</code>: which can describe 3D models with attributes (basically a wrapper around the <code>gltf</code> binary format, mentioned before).</li>
<li><code>i3dm</code>: similar to <code>b3dm</code>, but for instanced models (e.g. trees) where the geometry is defined once and then rendered multiple times.</li>
<li><code>pnts</code>: for point-cloud data.</li>
<li><code>cmpt</code>: for composite objects (combinations of the above).</li>
</ul>
<p>3D Tiles’ main benefit is that it can support the basic requirements for BAG 3D data, but it requires a complicated toolchain to be built in order to be able to produce such a dataset. The specification is too complex for a simple distribution of city objects across the country. Nevertheless, data is stored and distributed in a binary format which makes them more efficient (less network bandwidth is used).</p>
<p>There is software to create 3D tiles, but the most robust solutions are provided from Cesium. They implicitly push people to use their own services, e.g. most examples refers to their proprietary services (Cesium Ion). There are other open-source implementations for creating 3D tiles (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/Geodan/pg2b3dm/">pg2b3dm</a>), but mostly sparse functionality is provided and reliability is questionable.</p>
<h4 id="i3s"><a href="https://github.com/Esri/i3s-spec">i3s</a></h4>
<p>A specification by ESRI for the delivery of complex 3D scenes, which is an OGC community standard. Intends to serve the same purpose as 3D Tiles, basically, but offers a far more complex and feature-rich solution to it.</p>
<p>The main difference between i3s and 3D Tiles is that the first mainly focuses on the delivery of geometric information, while the semantic aspect of the model is served on-demand (only when necessary). That is contrary to the fact that 3D Tiles serves both semantics and geometries in one chunk per tile. This maximises the number of network requests, but minimises the amount of data originally required to view the geometries.</p>
<p>While i3s have been around for as much as 3D Tiles, there is far less use to it in 3D city models delivery. An implementation of the i3s would also require more work than 3D Tiles, given that the latter reuses the glTF technology which is “native” for 3D web viewers of all kinds.</p>
<h4 id="cityjson"><a href="https://www.cityjson.org/">CityJSON</a></h4>
<p>An open specification developed by the 3D geoinformation group of TU Delft, which is in the process of being established as an OGC community standard. Basically, a JSON encoding of the CityGML data model, which describes city objects with 3D geometries, attributes and semantic information.</p>
<p>It provides complex features, such the ability to have attributes per surface of a 3D object (e.g. a roof of a building), multiple textures/materials etc. Certain optimisation techniques are utilised, such as compression of vertices (minimises storage and standardises precision of coordinates). Metadata support is extensive (CRS included).</p>
<p>The specification is built to be used mostly for the storage of data per city region. Due to its use of indexed vertices, it cannot be used to distirbute parts of the region. Should be the most storage-expensive alternative of all, as well. It’s the least efficient for the use with a nation-wide web viewer, but is the best data format to store the 3D city models on the server.</p>
<h4 id="ogc-api-features-wfs3">OGC API Features (‘WFS3’)</h4>
<p>An OGC standard for an on-demand service that returns data according to the user’s request parameters (REST API). It’s format agnostic, meaning that data can be returned in any format (CityJSON, CityGML etc.).</p>
<p>Currently, there is experimental work on an implementation for CityJSON. Regarding bandwidth, it potentially be decent enough, but it requires constant calculation from the server in order to compute and produce the result.</p>
<h4 id="dcitydb">3DcityDB</h4>
<p>A database schema to store CityGML information, developed by virtualcitySYSTEMS. Can be used with PostgreSQL or Oracle databases. There is a tool to load data from CityGML/CityJSON with a GUI (all Java technology). It is also possible to export data in 3D Tiles.</p>
<h3 id="viewers">Viewers</h3>
<h4 id="three.js"><a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a></h4>
<p>A low-level framework to ease the development of 3D web application. Utilises WebGL. Is the most flexible option, given that manipulation of data is done directly in the lowest level (meshes, textures, materials etc). Has been around for years and is the most popular choice for a web 3D graphics engine.</p>
<p>There is no GIS/tiling functionality. Any data format of the above needs to be implemented for the specific use case. For the moment, there is <a href="ninja.cityjson.org">ninja</a> that uses it with CityJSON and certain aspects of the code could be reused. No robust and reliable solution exists for 3D tiles or any other tiling mechanism whatsoever. There is a promising open-source project , though, from <a href="https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/3DTilesRendererJS">NASA AMMOS</a>.</p>
<p>Can be used to produce very pleasing viewers, such as <a href="https://demo.f4map.com/">f4map</a> (not open source), or <a href="https://parallel.co.uk/netherlands/#13.8/52.365/4.9/0/40">vizicities</a>.</p>
<!-- Might not be relevant:  http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/nexus/ -->
<h4 id="cesiumjs"><a href="https://cesium.com/index.html">CesiumJS</a></h4>
<p>Developed by Cesium, which also created the 3D tiles specification. It is basically a 3D globe with the ability to show 3D geoinformation from multiple formats.</p>
<p>Functionality is extensive and many GIS features are available (e.g. support for CRS). Yet, the software is bloated and needs extreme fine-tuning to achieve decent performance. Also, all implementations look alike and the result is not necessarily the most eye-pleasing for the general audience.</p>
<p>Most famous 3D city model’s viewer implemented with CesiumJS is <strong>virtualcityMAP</strong>, from virtualcitySYSTEMS.</p>
<p>Multiple agencies and organisations use it, mostly because of the out-of-the-box support for 3D tiles and because virtualcitySYSTEMS promotes it. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://map.geo.admin.ch/?layers=ch.swisstopo.swissnames3d&amp;lon=8.24528&amp;lat=46.04722&amp;elevation=87928&amp;heading=360.000&amp;pitch=-44.188&amp;lang=en&amp;topic=ech&amp;bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe">SwissTopo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.3drotterdam.nl/#/">3D Rotterdam</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mapbox-gl"><a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/">Mapbox GL</a></h4>
<p>A library to build viewers that consume Mapbox data. There is limited 3D viewing functionality out-of-the-box (mostly 2.5 through extrusion), but one can use three.js directly to import/visualise complex 3D models.</p>
<p>Default functionality is very efficient and easy in the eye for regular users. There is <a href="https://github.com/Geodan/mapbox-3dtiles">experimental</a> support for 3D Tiles (useful for LoD2). 3D terrain currently is not supported, but it seems that Mapbox is looking into it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.mapbox.com/bringing-3d-terrain-to-the-browser-with-three-js-410068138357">3D terrain rendering</a></li>
<li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@mourner/martin-real-time-rtin-terrain-mesh">3D terrain simplification</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple higher-level frameworks to work directly with data, such as: <a href="https://deck.gl/#/">deck.gl</a>.</p>
<p>Examples:<br>
<a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/opendata/noise3d/lod13map.html">https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/opendata/noise3d/lod13map.html</a></p>
<h4 id="harp.gl"><a href="https://www.harp.gl">harp.gl</a></h4>
<p>It is similar to MapBox, but for Here maps (Microsoft). This is slightly more low-level than MapBox, though. Pretty much, has similar benefits and drawbacks with Mapbox, but is far less popular.</p>
<h4 id="ninja"><a href="https://github.com/cityjson/ninja">ninja</a></h4>
<p>A CityJSON web viewer. Uses Vuejs for the GUI and threejs for 3D visualisation. Focuses a lot on the semantic aspect of the model (objects’ hierarchy, details of the content of an object).</p>
<p>There is currently no support for terrain, except for TINRelief in CityJSON. It is also intended to work as stand-alone, without a backend. The user loads their own data in the viewer. There are plans to change this, though, and it should be easy to adopt it to a visualiser of OGC API Features.</p>
<p>The vue components are reusable through <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cityjson-vue-components">cityjson-vue-components</a>, so it should be easy to build a new viewer with some of the parts of ninja for the purposes of BAG 3D. The only limitation is that it requires Vuejs to be used as a front-end.</p>
<h2 id="three-scenarios-for-implementing-the-viewer">Three scenarios for implementing the viewer</h2>
<p>Based on the available state of the art tools we listed before, we propose three general scenarios to implement a viewer.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-1-cesiumjs--3d-tiles">Scenario 1: CesiumJS + 3D tiles</h3>
<p>Delivering data as 3D Tiles and consuming through CesiumJS seems like the most straightforward approach for such a viewer. It is the easiest way to start (no wonder why most agencies use it already), but also have the biggest drawbacks in performance and usability (no wonder why people don’t really use them that much).</p>
<h4 id="pros">Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Those technologies play very well with each other (both Cesium products).</li>
<li>It’s easy to start with this combination. We managed to build a <a href="https://github.com/liberostelios/cesium-prototype">prototype</a> in less than an hour, using FME to create 3D tiles (not that reliable) and following their <a href="https://www.cesium.com/docs/tutorials/cesium-and-webpack/">guide</a>.</li>
<li>3D Tiles ensure good enough performance, regarding network transactions. Data exchange speed will never be too bad.</li>
<li>CesiumJS ensures certain extent of geo-features out-of-the-box:
<ul>
<li>easy support for terrain with drapped images from multiple sources,</li>
<li>styling per attribute,</li>
<li>support for many GIS and 3D formats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cons">Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Requires that 3D tiles are somehow created as a cache of the data (that’s both good and bad). There are many ways on how to do that, but best one is to use Cesium’s proprietary products and services.</li>
<li>Cesium seems to promote their services a lot. Even in their documentation it becomes difficult to designate which parts are the open source/standard technologies and what are their proprietary products (e.g. they push a lot Cesium Ion, their own data delivery service).</li>
<li>3D tiles are open standard and famous, but still the most reliable solution is using Cesium’s propriatery software/services.</li>
<li>Vendor lock-in is still a minor possibility, based on the previous. While all is open source/standards, the community hasn’t gone too far to overcome the software monopoly of Cesium in the ecosystem.</li>
<li>Performance can never be great. While web transactions are optimised, CesiumJS is bloated and best case scenario with a local hosted solution is to get good performance. For most computers, using a single CesiumJS viewer might be challenging, so building any sophisticated UI using a JavaScript front-end would definitely make performance worse. That limits the choices of GUI and requires higher amount of time for optimisation to deliver a useful final app.</li>
<li>Final product looks always the same. You can tell that a tool is based on Cesium from miles and that’s not a good thing, because it looks boring and doesn’t attract the user (that’s, also, due to the performance).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scenario-2-mapbox-gl--3d-tiles">Scenario 2: Mapbox GL + 3D Tiles</h3>
<p>MapBox is better performing than CesiumJS. Nevertheless, there is no reliable solution for using 3D Tiles with it, except for a <a href="https://github.com/Geodan/mapbox-3dtiles">prototype</a> developed by Geodan. Further development towards this direction would be needed. Mapbox’s power would show when using 2.5D data like LoD 1.x (so, practically when not using any 3D geometries at all). Implementing a full 3D solution is challenging since the viewer is not intended for consumption of truly 3D data. For example, in Geodan’s prototype a terrain is visualised, but collides with the existing 2D plane of the viewer.</p>
<h4 id="pros-1">Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Similar feature-set as CesiumJS, but better performance (mostly).</li>
<li>Optimised for data viewing in simple use cases, where footprint can height can be used. This can be used to have a robust viewer for certain LoDs (e.g. LoD1.x).</li>
<li>3D features can be added by implementing a three.js layer</li>
<li>Easy to use and adapt. Good styling mechanism, more consumer-friendly.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cons-1">Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only supports 2D geometry sources out of the box.</li>
<li>Performance and features for complex 3D geometries still lagging (e.g. for LoD2).</li>
<li>Limited 3D support. No reliable solution for 3D tiles, so custom implementation/maintenance of a 3D tiles parser will be necessary.</li>
<li>Not really possible to elegantly implement 3D terrain since there is always a 2D baselayer.</li>
<li>Vendor lock-in is a possibility, maybe slightly more prominent than Cesium. They promote their own proprietary services. Using their own open software/standards (e.g. vector tiles) is very hard without their support.</li>
<li>Performance is not guaranteed, since custom code has to be writted for 3D tiles (and complex 3D geometries in general).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scenario-3-three.js--3d-tilesogc-api">Scenario 3: three.js + 3D tiles/OGC API</h3>
<p>Three.js is by far the most low-level framework of all. A custom-made solution using three.js would required manipulation of all graphics aspects (scene management, lighting, camera etc.) which is more complex. Yet, performance can be as good as the time invested in the development. Also, efficient use of shaders/post-processing effects could make a far more good-looking 3D output than anything else, without sacrificing performance.</p>
<h4 id="pros-2">Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Rendering quality and performance possibilities are endless (could look as good as a game). A good implementation could look and perform as good as <a href="https://demo.f4map.com/">f4map</a> does.</li>
<li>No bloated functionality or redundant features. Everything will be tailored to the requested needs (which allows better performance).</li>
<li>Plethora of <a href="https://threejs.org/examples">examples</a> and prototyped code to combine in order to achieve certain results, both visually and for geo-processing (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d/cityjson-vue-components">CityJSON Vue components</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/3DTilesRendererJS">3DTilesRendererJS</a>).</li>
<li>Can be more dynamic. For instance, 3D tiles and OGC API can be used interchangeably to re-use parts of the delivery service.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cons-2">Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most things have to be re-implemented, for example:
<ul>
<li>terrain support</li>
<li>management and parsing of tiles</li>
<li>camera movement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Performance could be abysmal, if things are not implemented right.</li>
<li>Higher maintenance cost. Bugs will appear in functionality that otherwise comes out-of-the-box with CesiumJS or MapBox GL.</li>
</ul>

</table><h3 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h3>
<p>Succesfully implementing a web viewer for a nation-wide 3D citymodel will has its challenges. We believe the main focus should be given in providing the most pleasing experience to the user. Features should be implemented only when they don’t cause performance to deteriorate or cause too much confusion to the user. This is further underpinned by the novel nature of 3D geoinformation and the lower level of comfort users have using 3D technologies.</p>
<p>Therefore, while the easiest and more straightforward approach might seem to be an implementation on top of CesiumJS, we would strongly suggest that a more streamlined solution, tailored for the specific use case is developed. This is highly dependent on the amount of time one wants to invest in development and maintenance.</p>
<p>To us, building a platform with multiple data sources, efficient viewing and displaying the right amount information to the information is always a process that requires heavy development and a lot of experimentation on the UI perspective. Therefore, developing a custom made solution using three.js would, eventually, not have as much as difference in time spent than one building on top of CesiumJS. In fact, maintaining a clean and hand-tailored codebase could be an advantage of a from-scratch solution, than building and relying on external libraries and services.</p>
<p>Another point that needs to be carefully thought is the delivery of data. We think that a solution would only ensure performance when dynamic content extraction is minimised. This means that data have to be statically created so that they are available to the user (and the viewer) without any overhead. Therefore, a combination of 3D Tiles and CityJSON should be the best combination for such a platform: 3D Tiles can act as the “cached” content that the viewer consumes to ensure performance; and CityJSON can be the format which users can use to download data with. Both, would require minimal workload on the server side and low requirements for processing on the infrastructure.</p>
<p>Finally, an OGC API Features service would be beneficial for users with more specific needs or for other platforms/services to be built with the available data. In this case, though, a careful requirements analysis needs to be conducted to ensure that a strong enough infastructure can support the workload of executing dynamic queries.</p>
